##### Notice: <br> This project made some improvements to Valum's initial AJAX uploader, but it is no longer actively maintained.  Some bugs may remain unfixed.  A commercial fork of this project (with a licencing fee) with many bugfixes is available at http://fineuploader.com/. <br> Interested maintainers for this project may post on the [issues forum](https://github.com/Valums-File-Uploader/file-uploader/issues).

### Valum's File Uploader v2.0 beta ###

Welcome! This project attempts to achieve a user-friendly file-uploading experience over the web. 
It's built as a Javascript plugin for developers looking to incorporate file-uploading into their website.

This is a public fork of Valum's File Uploader (v1) in an attempt to incorporate some of the best 
bugfixes and patches to make a version compatible with the latest browsers in 2012.

We would love developers to contribute any improvements and bugfixes they produce.
See [How do I contribute to other's code in GitHub?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4384776/how-do-i-contribute-to-others-code-in-github).

Initiated by <a href="https://github.com/SimonEast">SimonEast</a>, but interested maintainers are welcome.


### Summary ###

This plugin uses an XMLHttpRequest (AJAX) for uploading multiple files with a progress-bar in 
FF3.6+, Safari4+, Chrome and falls back to hidden-iframe-based upload in other browsers (namely IE), 
providing good user experience everywhere.

It does not use Flash, jQuery, or any external libraries.

### Known Issues ###
Plugin breaks back button functionality in Opera.
	
### Getting started ###
The `fileuploader.js` contains two classes that are meant to be used directly.
If you need a complete upload widget (from demo) to quickly drop
into your current design, use `qq.FileUploader`.

If you want to customize uploader, by using a different looking file list
or change the behaviour or functionality use `qq.FileUploaderBasic`.

The difference between them is that `qq.FileUploader` provides a list of files,
drag-and-drop, but `qq.FileUploaderBasic` only creates button and handles validation.
Basic uploader is easier extendable, and doesn't limit possible customization.

`qq.FileUploader` extends `qq.FileUploaderBasic`, so that all the options present
in the basic uploader also exist in the full widget.  

### qq.FileUploader - Setting up full upload widget ###

Include `fileuploader.js` and `fileuploader.css` into your page.
Create container element.

```html
<div id="file-uploader">       
<noscript>          
    <p>Please enable JavaScript to use file uploader.</p>
    <!-- or put a simple form for upload here -->
</noscript>         
</div>
```

Initialize uploader when the DOM is ready. Change the action option.
For example ../server/php.php for the default folder structure.
In the server folder you will find examples for different platforms.
If you can't find the one you need, check the readme.txt in the same folder. 

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FileUploader({
	// pass the dom node (ex. $(selector)[0] for jQuery users)
	element: document.getElementById('file-uploader'),
	// path to server-side upload script
	action: '/server/upload'
}); 
```

### Options of both classes ###

```javascript
    // url of the server-side upload script, should be on the same domain
    action: '/server/upload',
    // additional data to send, name-value pairs
    params: {},
    
    // validation    
    // ex. ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif'] or []
    allowedExtensions: [],        
    // each file size limit in bytes
    // this option isn't supported in all browsers
    sizeLimit: 0, // max size   
    minSizeLimit: 0, // min size
    abortOnFailure: true, // Fail all files if one doesn't meet the criteria
    
    // set to true to output server response to console
    debug: false,
    
    // events         
    // you can return false to abort submit
    onSubmit: function(id, fileName){},
    onProgress: function(id, fileName, loaded, total){},
    onComplete: function(id, fileName, responseJSON){},
    onCancel: function(id, fileName){},
    onError: function(id, fileName, xhr){}
    
    messages: {
        // error messages, see qq.FileUploaderBasic for content            
    },
    showMessage: function(message){ alert(message); }        
```

Instance methods

* `setParams(newParams)`

#### Changing alert/messages to something more user friendly ####

If you limited file types and max size, you will probably want to change the default alert and
messages as you see fit, this is possible using showMessage callback and messages option.

#### Sending additional params ####

To add a parameter that will be passed as a query string with each upload use params option. 

```javascript
    var uploader = new qq.FileUploader({
        element: document.getElementById('file-uploader'),
        action: '/server-side.upload',
        // additional data to send, name-value pairs
        params: {
            param1: 'value1',
            param2: 'value2'
        }
    });
```

To change params based on the state of your app, use 

```javascript
    uploader.setParams({
       anotherParam: 'value' 
    });
```

It can be nicely used in `onSubmit` callback.      

#### Troubleshooting ####

If you can't get the uploader to work, please try the following steps
before asking for help.

If the upload doesn't complete, saying "failed":

* Set the `debug` option of the FileUploader to true.
* Open the page where you have a FileUploader.
* Open developer console in your browser.
* Try to upload the file. You should see a server serponse.

It should be `{success:true}` for completed requests. If it's not,
then you have a problem with your server-side script.
