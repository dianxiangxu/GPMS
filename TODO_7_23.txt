TODO:

1. AuditLog Table to bind for @UserProfileID and @ProposalID sorted based on Activity Date
{"offset":1,"limit":10,"auditLogBindObj":{"Action":null,"AuditedBy":null,"ActivityOnFrom":null,"ActivityOnTo"
:null}}

For User based Audit I already added : 
public List<AuditLogInfo> findAllForUserAuditLogGrid(int offset, int limit,
			String action, String auditedBy, String activityOnFrom,
			String activityOnTo)

Method in UserProfileDAO need to make it working!
- Here activityOnFrom and activityOnTo is the DATE range! If any one of them is not SET then need to assume that user is searching all valid range 

For example, if user only searching for activityonFrom then all above that need to be fetched and if only activityOnTo is SET then below that need to be fetched!

And if both are set then Range in between those two dates need to be fetched!

Similarly need to add another method for Proposal in ProposalDAO file
public List<AuditLogInfo> findAllForProposalAuditLogGrid(int offset, int limit,
			String action, String auditedBy, String activityOnFrom,
			String activityOnTo)			
	
2. BUT, In User Audit Log we need to merge the both Audit logs from UserProfile and UserAccount


3. Search Method with null or something values on each parameters! i.e. projectTitle, totalCostsFrom  for Proposal Grid
BindProposalGrid (int offset, int limit, String projectTitle, String totalCostsFrom, String totalCostsTo, String proposalStatus (This is a DropDown Value so need to be exactly on db match NOT to use Contains!), String proposedBy, String receivedOnFrom, String receivedOnTo, String active)

- Here totalCostsFrom and totalCostsTo is the range (double) for the Total Costs so if either is filled and searched based on that
similarly  receivedOnFrom and receivedOnTo is the DATE range!
