var carlike = function(obj, loc) { // this function is called carlike and has 2 parametres, obj and loc
    obj.loc = loc; // what does this do exactly?? I get the dot notation, but I'm not sure exactly what is happening
    return obj; // returns the value of object, but what was the point of setting obj.loc = loc if going to return obj?
}; // ends the function

var move = function(car) { //
    car.loc++; //
}; // ends the function


amy.move(); // how does this work? I know its dot notation and                       is calling the function move(), but I don't get exactly what it is doing //
var ben = carlike({}, 9);
ben.move(); // same thing as amy()
