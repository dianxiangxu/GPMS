<div class="paperBody">
<p>Recently I've been reading drafts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805829?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596805829">Rest In Practice</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321601912" width="0" height="0" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; display: none !important; visibility: hidden !important; opacity: 0 !important; background-position: 1px 1px;">: a book that a couple of my
  colleagues have been working on. Their aim is to explain how to use
  Restful web services to handle many of the integration problems that
  enterprises face. At the heart of the book is the notion that the
  web is an existence proof of a massively scalable distributed system
  that works really well, and we can take ideas from that to build
  integrated systems more easily.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p class="figureImage"><a name="images_richardsonMaturityModel_overview.png"></a><img alt="Figure 1" src="./Richardson Maturity Model_files/overview.png" style=""></p>

<p class="figureCaption">Figure 1: Steps
  toward REST</p>
</div>

<p>To help explain the specific properties of a web-style system,
  the authors use a model of restful maturity that was developed by
  <a href="http://www.crummy.com/">Leonard Richardson</a> and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/writing/speaking/2008-QCon/act3.html">explained</a>
  at a QCon talk. The model is nice way to think about using these
  techniques, so I thought I'd take a stab of my own explanation of
  it. (The protocol examples here are only illustrative, I didn't feel it
  was worthwhile to code and test them up, so there may be problems in
  the detail.)</p>

<div id="level0"><hr class="topSection">
<h2>Level 0</h2>

<p>The starting point for the model is using HTTP as a transport
    system for remote interactions, but without using any of the
    mechanisms of the web. Essentially what you are doing here is
    using HTTP as a tunneling mechanism for your own remote
    interaction mechanism, usually based on <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/EncapsulatedSynchronousIntegration.html">Remote
    Procedure Invocation</a>.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p class="figureImage"><a name="images_richardsonMaturityModel_level0.png"></a><img alt="Figure 2" src="./Richardson Maturity Model_files/level0.png" style=""></p>

<p class="figureCaption">Figure 2: An example
    interaction at Level 0</p>
</div>

<p>Let's assume I want to book an appointment with my doctor. My
    appointment software first needs to know what open slots my doctor
    has on a given date, so it makes a request of the hospital
    appointment system to obtain that information. In a level 0
    scenario, the hospital will expose a service endpoint at some
    URI. I then post to that endpoint a document containing the
    details of my request.</p>

<pre>POST /appointmentService HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;openSlotRequest date = "2010-01-04" doctor = "mjones"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>The server then will return a document giving me this information</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot start = "1400" end = "1450"&gt;
    &lt;doctor id = "mjones"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;slot start = "1600" end = "1650"&gt;
    &lt;doctor id = "mjones"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</pre>

<p>I'm using XML here for the example, but the content can
    actually be anything: JSON, YAML, key-value pairs, or any custom
    format.</p>

<p>My next step is to book an appointment, which I can again do
    by posting a document to the endpoint.</p>

<pre>POST /appointmentService HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;slot doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</pre>

<p>If all is well I get a response saying my appointment is
    booked.</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</pre>

<p>If there is a problem, say someone else got in before me, then
    I'll get some kind of error message in the reply body.</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;appointmentRequestFailure&gt;
  &lt;slot doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
  &lt;reason&gt;Slot not available&lt;/reason&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequestFailure&gt;
</pre>

<p>So far this is a straightforward RPC style system. It's simple
    as it's just slinging plain old XML (POX) back and forth. If you
    use SOAP or XML-RPC it's basically the same mechanism, the only
    difference is that you wrap the XML messages in some kind of
    envelope.</p>
</div>

<div id="level1"><hr class="topSection">
<h2>Level 1 - Resources</h2>

<p>The first step towards the Glory of Rest in the RMM is to
    introduce resources. So now rather than making all our requests to
    a singular service endpoint, we now start talking to individual
    resources.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p class="figureImage"><a name="images_richardsonMaturityModel_level1.png"></a><img alt="Figure 3" src="./Richardson Maturity Model_files/level1.png" style=""></p>

<p class="figureCaption">Figure 3: Level 1
    adds resources</p>
</div>

<p>So with our initial query, we might have a resource for given
    doctor.</p>

<pre>POST /doctors/mjones HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;openSlotRequest date = "2010-01-04"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>The reply carries the same basic information, but each slot is
    now a resource that can be addressed individually.</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]


&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"/&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</pre>

<p>With specific resources booking an appointment means posting to
    a particular slot.</p>

<pre>POST /slots/1234 HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</pre>

<p>If all goes well I get a similar reply to before.</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</pre>

<p>The difference now is that if anyone needs to do anything about
    the appointment, like book some tests, they first get hold of the
    appointment resource, which might have a URI like
    <code>http://royalhope.nhs.uk/slots/1234/appointment</code>, and post to
    that resource.</p>

<p>To an object guy like me this is like the notion of object
    identity. Rather than calling some function in the ether and
    passing arguments, we call a method on one particular object
    providing arguments for the other information.</p>
</div>

<div id="level2"><hr class="topSection">
<h2>Level 2 - HTTP Verbs</h2>

<p>I've used HTTP POST verbs for all my interactions here in level
    0 and 1, but some people use GETs instead or in addition. At these
    levels it doesn't make much difference, they are both being used
    as tunneling mechanisms allowing you to tunnel your interactions
    through HTTP. Level 2 moves away from this, using the HTTP verbs
    as closely as possible to how they are used in HTTP itself.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p class="figureImage"><a name="images_richardsonMaturityModel_level2.png"></a><img alt="Figure 4" src="./Richardson Maturity Model_files/level2.png" style=""></p>

<p class="figureCaption">Figure 4: Level 2
    addes HTTP verbs</p>
</div>

<p>For our the list of slots, this means we want to use
    GET.</p>

<pre>GET /doctors/mjones/slots?date=20100104&amp;status=open HTTP/1.1
Host: royalhope.nhs.uk
</pre>

<p>The reply is the same as it would have been with the POST</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"/&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</pre>

<p>At Level 2, the use of GET for a request like this is
    crucial. HTTP defines GET as a safe operation, that is it doesn't
    make any significant changes to the state of anything. This allows
    us to invoke GETs safely any number of times in any order and get
    the same results each time. An important consequence of this is
    that it allows any participant in the routing of requests to use
    caching, which is a key element in making the web perform as well
    as it does. HTTP includes various measures to support caching,
    which can be used by all participants in the communication. By
    following the rules of HTTP we're able to take advantage of that
    capability.</p>

<p>To book an appointment we need an HTTP verb that does change state,
    a POST or a PUT. I'll use the same POST that I did earlier.</p>

<pre>POST /slots/1234 HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</pre>

<p>The trade-offs between using POST and PUT here are more than I
    want to go into here, maybe I'll do a separate article on them
    some day. But I do want to point out that some people incorrectly
    make a correspondence between POST/PUT and create/update. The
    choice between them is rather different to that.</p>

<p>Even if I use the same post as level 1, there's another
    significant difference in how the remote service responds. If all
    goes well, the service replies with a response code of 201 to
    indicate that there's a new resource in the world.</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: slots/1234/appointment
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</pre>

<p>The 201 response includes a location attribute with a URI that
    the client can use to GET the current state of that resource in
    the future. The response here also includes a representation of
    that resource to save the client an extra call right now.</p>

<p>There is another difference if something
    goes wrong, such as someone else booking the session.</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"/&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</pre>

<p>The important part of this response is the use of an HTTP
    response code to indicate something has gone wrong. In this case a
    409 seems a good choice to indicate that someone else has already
    updated the resource in an incompatible way. Rather than using a
    return code of 200 but including an error response, at level 2 we
    explicitly use some kind of error response like this. It's up to
    the protocol designer to decide what codes to use, but there
    should be a non-2xx response if an error crops up. Level 2
    introduces using HTTP verbs and HTTP response codes.</p>

<p>There is an inconsistency creeping in here. REST advocates talk
    about using all the HTTP verbs. They also justify their approach
    by saying that REST is attempting to learn from the practical
    success of the web. But the world-wide web doesn't use PUT or
    DELETE much in practice. There are sensible reasons for using
    PUT and DELETE more, but the existence proof of the web isn't one
    of them.</p>

<p>The key elements that are supported by the existence of the
    web are the strong separation between safe (eg GET) and non-safe
    operations, together with using status codes to help communicate
    the kinds of errors you run into.</p>
</div>

<div id="level3"><hr class="topSection">
<h2>Level 3 - Hypermedia Controls</h2>

<p>The final level introduces something that you often hear
    referred to under the ugly acronym of HATEOAS (Hypertext As The
    Engine Of Application State). It addresses the question of how to
    get from a list open slots to knowing what to do to book an
    appointment.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p class="figureImage"><a name="images_richardsonMaturityModel_level3.png"></a><img alt="Figure 5" src="./Richardson Maturity Model_files/level3.png" style=""></p>

<p class="figureCaption">Figure 5: Level 3
    adds hypermedia controls</p>
</div>

<p>We begin with the same initial GET that we sent in level 2</p>

<pre>GET /doctors/mjones/slots?date=20100104&amp;status=open HTTP/1.1
Host: royalhope.nhs.uk
</pre>

<p>But the response has a new element</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"&gt;
     &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/slot/book" 
           uri = "/slots/1234"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"&gt;
     &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/slot/book" 
           uri = "/slots/5678"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</pre>

<p>Each slot now has a link element which contains a URI to tell
    us how to book an appointment.</p>

<p>The point of hypermedia controls is that they tell us what we
    can do next, and the URI of the resource we need to manipulate to
    do it. Rather than us having to know where to post our appointment
    request, the hypermedia controls in the response tell us how to do
    it.</p>

<p>The POST would again copy that of level 2</p>

<pre>POST /slots/1234 HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</pre>

<p>And the reply contains a number of hypermedia controls for
    different things to do next.</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://royalhope.nhs.uk/slots/1234/appointment
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/cancel"
        uri = "/slots/1234/appointment"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/addTest"
        uri = "/slots/1234/appointment/tests"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "self"
        uri = "/slots/1234/appointment"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/changeTime"
        uri = "/doctors/mjones/slots?date=20100104@status=open"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/updateContactInfo"
        uri = "/patients/jsmith/contactInfo"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/help"
        uri = "/help/appointment"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</pre>

<p>One obvious benefit of hypermedia controls is that it allows
    the server to change its URI scheme without breaking clients. As
    long as clients look up the "addTest" link URI then the server
    team can juggle all URIs other than the initial entry points.</p>

<p>A further benefit is that it helps client developers explore
    the protocol. The links give client developers a hint as to what
    may be possible next. It doesn't give all the information: both
    the "latest" and "cancel" controls point to the same URI - they need
    to figure out that one is a GET and the other a DELETE. But at
    least it gives them a starting point as to what to think about for
    more information and to look for a similar URI in the protocol
    documentation.</p>

<p>Similarly it allows the server team to advertise new
    capabilities by putting new links in the responses. If the client
    developers are keeping an eye out for unknown links these links
    can be a trigger for further exploration.</p>

<p>There's no absolute standard as to how to represent hypermedia
    controls. What I've done here is to use the current
    recommendations of the REST in Practice team, which is to follow
    ATOM (<a href="http://atompub.org/rfc4287.html">RFC 4287</a>) I
    use a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element with a <code>uri</code>
    attribute for the target URI and a <code>rel</code> attribute for
    to describe the kind of relationship. A well known relationship
    (such as <code>self</code> for a reference to the element itself)
    is bare, any specific to that server is a fully qualified
    URI. ATOM states that the definition for well-known linkrels is
    the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations.html">Registry of
    Link Relations </a>. As I write these are confined to what's done
    by ATOM, which is generally seen as a leader in level 3
    restfulness.</p>
</div>

<div id="TheMeaningOfTheLevels"><hr class="topSection">
<h2>The Meaning of the Levels</h2>

<p>I should stress that the RMM, while a good way to think about
    what the elements of REST, is not a definition of levels of REST
    itself. Roy Fielding has made it clear that <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">level
    3 RMM is a pre-condition of REST</a>. Like many terms in software,
    REST gets lots of definitions, but since Roy Fielding coined the
    term, his definition should carry more weight than most.</p>

<p>What I find useful about this RMM is that it provides a good
    step by step way to understand the basic ideas behind restful
    thinking. As such I see it as tool to help us learn about the
    concepts and not something that should be used in some kind of assessment
    mechanism. I don't think we have enough examples yet to be really
    sure that the restful approach is the right way to integrate systems, I
    do think it's a very attractive approach and the one that I would
    recommend in most situations.</p>

<p>Talking about this with Ian Robinson, he stressed that
    something he found attractive about this model when Leonard
    Richardson first presented it was its relationship to common design
    techniques.</p>

<ul>
<li>Level 1 tackles the question of handling complexity by using
      divide and conquer, breaking a large service endpoint down into
      multiple resources.</li>

<li>Level 2 introduces a standard set of verbs so that we handle
      similar situations in the same way, removing unnecessary
      variation.</li>

<li>Level 3 introduces discoverability, providing a way of
      making a protocol more self-documenting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a model that helps us think about the kind of
    HTTP service we want to provide and frame the expectations of
    people looking to interact with it.</p>
